# 📋 Queue Management System - Complete Explanation (Easy Version)

## What Does This Project Do?

This is a **digital queue management system** for clinics, banks, or customer service centers. Instead of paper numbers, patients/customers get digital tokens and can track their wait time in real-time on a dashboard.

---

## Real-World Example

Imagine a clinic:

- **Patient arrives** → Takes a token from a kiosk (digital device)
- **Token shows number** → #15
- **Patient sees dashboard** → "You are waiting. Time waited: 2 minutes 30 seconds"
- **Real-time countdown** → Timer keeps counting as they wait
- **When ready** → Admin calls "Token #15 to Window A"
- **Patient arrives** → System records they arrived after waiting 5 minutes 30 seconds

---

## The 3 Main Parts

### 1️⃣ **THE KIOSK** (Where patients get tokens)

- Physical device or web simulator
- Patient presses button
- Kiosk creates a token with their info
- Patient gets ticket: "Token #15"

### 2️⃣ **THE SERVER** (The brain of the system)

- Runs on your computer
- Receives token requests from kiosk
- Stores all queue data
- Sends real-time updates to dashboards
- Saves everything to DynamoDB (backup storage)

### 3️⃣ **THE DASHBOARD** (What patient/staff see)

- Website patients open on their phone
- Shows: "Your token is #15"
- Shows: "Time waited: 2m 30s" (counts up live)
- Admin page: Lets staff mark patients as "served" or "skipped"

## Step-by-Step: What Happens When a Patient Gets a Token

### **STEP 1: Patient Uses Kiosk**

```
Patient enters name and phone number on kiosk screen
Patient clicks: "Get Token"
```

### **STEP 2: Kiosk Sends Request to Server**

```
Kiosk says to Server: "Create token for John Doe, phone 123-456-7890"
Connection: WebSocket (Socket.IO) - instant message
```

### **STEP 3: Server Creates Token**

```javascript
// Server does this:
Token #15 created
Time: Oct 18, 2025, 10:30 AM
Name: John Doe
Phone: 123-456-7890
Status: Waiting
Waiting Time: 0 seconds (just started)
```

### **STEP 4: Server Saves to Database**

```
DynamoDB stores this data permanently
(So if server crashes, data isn't lost)
```

### **STEP 5: Server Tells All Dashboards**

```
Server broadcasts: "New token #15 added to queue!"
All connected phones/computers get this message instantly
```

### **STEP 6: Patient Dashboard Updates**

```
Patient opens phone browser
Sees: "Your Token #15"
Sees: "You are 2nd in queue"
Sees: "Waiting time: 0s"
Timer starts counting up: 1s, 2s, 3s...
```

## The 3 Websites in the Project

### Website 1: **User Dashboard**

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

**What you see:**

- Profile section (name, phone)
- "Take Token" button
- Your current token number
- How long you've been waiting (live counter!)

**What happens:**

1. Enter your name
2. Click "Take Token"
3. Kiosk creates your token
4. See your token number
5. Watch timer count seconds waiting
6. Click "Mark Arrived" when you reach the window

---

### Website 2: **Admin Dashboard**

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/admin.html`

**What staff see:**

- All tokens in queue (waiting, being served, done)
- "Serve" button (patient is ready to be seen)
- "Skip" button (move to next patient)
- "Reset" button (clear all tokens for next day)

**What happens:**

- Admin sees: "Token 15 - John Doe - Waiting 5m 30s"
- Admin clicks: "Serve Token 15"
- Patient app shows: "You're being served at Window A"
- Next token appears: "Token 16 - Jane Smith"

---

### Website 3: **Kiosk Simulator**

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/simulate.html`

**Why we need this:**

- Testing without a real kiosk device
- Simulates a kiosk device in the browser

**What happens:**

1. Open page → "Register as Kiosk" button appears
2. Click it → Page says "Registered as kiosk"
3. Now this browser acts like a kiosk machine
4. When patient clicks "Take Token" in user dashboard, simulator receives the request
5. Simulator automatically creates the token

---

## The Real-Time Magic (Socket.IO)

Socket.IO is like a **magical phone line** between kiosk, server, and dashboards.

### How Socket.IO Works

```
OLD WAY (HTTP - like sending letters):
Client: "Hello server, what's new?" (sends request)
Server: (takes 2 seconds to respond)
Server: "Here's the new queue" (sends response)
Client waits... and waits...

NEW WAY (Socket.IO - like phone call):
Client: (always connected to server)
Server: "Hey! New token arrived!"
Client: (instantly receives)
```

### Example in Real-Time

```
10:30:00 - Patient A takes token #15
10:30:01 - Server: "Token 15 created!" (broadcasts to all)
10:30:01 - Patient phones see instantly: Token 15 added
10:30:01 - Admin dashboard updates: Shows token 15
10:30:02 - Patient app shows: "Time waiting: 2s"
10:30:03 - Patient app shows: "Time waiting: 3s" (counter keeps going)
```

---

## The Data Storage (DynamoDB)

### Why DynamoDB?

**Without database:**

- Data stored only in computer memory
- If server crashes, all data lost!
- Can't access from another server

**With DynamoDB (AWS Database):**

- Data saved permanently in AWS cloud
- Even if server crashes, data is safe
- Multiple servers can access same data
- Can scale up automatically

### What Gets Saved?

```javascript
{
  Token: 15,
  Name: "John Doe",
  Phone: "123-456-7890",
  Time Started: "2025-10-18T10:30:00Z",
  Time Arrived: "2025-10-18T10:35:30Z",
  Wait Time: 330 seconds (5.5 minutes),
  Status: "arrived",
  Clinic ID: "default-clinic"
}
```

---

## The Waiting Time Calculation

### How Does the System Know Wait Time?

```
FRONTEND (Patient's Phone):
├─ Token created at: 10:30:00
├─ Timer starts counting: 0s, 1s, 2s...
├─ Every 2 seconds, sends to server: "I've been waiting 30s"
├─ Server saves to database
└─ Patient sees: "Time waiting: 30s"

If patient waits 5 minutes 30 seconds:
├─ Clicks "Mark Arrived"
├─ Sends to server: "Elapsed time: 330 seconds"
├─ Server saves: Wait time = 330 seconds
├─ Database stores: "Waited 5m 30s"
└─ Next patient sees: Average wait = 5m 30s (helps estimate)
```

## MQTT Integration (Optional - For IoT Devices)

### What is MQTT?

MQTT is a **messaging protocol** (like a postal service) for IoT devices to talk to each other.

### Why Do We Need It?

**Without MQTT:**

- Only browser dashboards can see updates
- Physical kiosks can't communicate with each other
- No integration with other clinic systems

**With MQTT:**

- Kiosks can talk to server
- Different departments can stay in sync
- Real-time alerts across multiple locations

### How MQTT Works in Our System

```
Kiosk Device (Physical)
    ↓ MQTT: "Token 15 created"
    ↓
AWS IoT Core (Cloud Message Broker)
    ↓ Forwards message
    ↓
Queue Server
    ↓ Socket.IO broadcast
    ↓
All Dashboards (Instant update!)
```

## Common Questions Answered

### Q: What happens if the server crashes?

**A:** All data is saved in DynamoDB. When server restarts, it loads all previous data. Patients' wait times are preserved!

### Q: Can multiple kiosks work at the same time?

**A:** Yes! All kiosks connect to the same server. Each creates unique token numbers automatically.

### Q: How many people can use the dashboard at once?

**A:** Thousands! Socket.IO handles real-time updates for many connected clients efficiently.

### Q: What if there's no internet?

**A:** The system stores locally on the server. But DynamoDB needs internet to sync. Without internet, only local storage works.

### Q: Can I use real IoT devices instead of simulator?

**A:** Yes! Use the Python or Node.js device examples provided. They connect via MQTT to AWS IoT Core.
