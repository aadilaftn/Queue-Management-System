✅ Status: Ready for kiosks
```

### Open These 3 Tabs:

**Tab 1 - Kiosk Simulator:**

```
http://localhost:3000/simulate.html
→ Click "Register as kiosk"
```

**Tab 2 - Patient Dashboard:**

```
http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 What Each Part Does

### 1. KIOSK (Token Creation)

```
"Give me a token!"
       ↓
Server: "You are #15"
```

### 2. SERVER (The Brain)

```
Kiosk → "Create token"
Server → "OK, Token #15 created"
       → Saves to database
       → Tells all screens
```

### 3. DASHBOARD (Patient Sees)

```
"Your Token: #15"
"Time waiting: 3m 45s"  ← Counts up automatically!
"You are 2nd in queue"
```

### 4. ADMIN (Staff Controls)

```
"Token #15 - John Doe - Waiting 5m"
Buttons: [Serve] [Skip] [Reset]
```

---

## 📊 Real-Time Data Flow

```
Patient Takes Token
       ↓
Kiosk sends: "Create for Ahmed"
       ↓
Server receives & processes
       ↓
Saves to DynamoDB
       ↓
Broadcasts to all browsers
       ↓
Screens update INSTANTLY
       ↓
Timer starts counting: 1s, 2s, 3s...
       ↓
Every 2 seconds: Sends update to server
       ↓
Database updated continuously
       ↓
When patient arrives: Final time saved
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Socket.IO (Real-Time Magic)

```
Old way (HTTP):
Client: "Hello? Any updates?" (wait...)
Server: "Yes, here's the data" (after 2 seconds)

New way (Socket.IO):
Server: "HEY! New token arrived!" (instantly)
Client: (gets message immediately)

Result: Everything updates LIVE without page refresh!
```

### Waiting Time Calculation

```
Token Created: 10:30:00
Current Time: 10:35:30
─────────────────────
Waiting Time: 5 minutes 30 seconds

Counting happens on patient's phone
Sent to server every 2 seconds
Saved to database continuously
Final time saved when patient arrives
```

### Database (DynamoDB)

```
Server (Local Memory):  Fast but loses data if crash
Database (Cloud):       Slow but permanent storage

We use BOTH:
1. Server handles real-time (fast)
2. Database backs up data (safe)

If server crashes:
→ Restart server
→ Load data from database
→ Nothing lost! 🎉
```

## 🧪 Test It Right Now

### Scenario: Patient Gets Token

**Step 1: Register Kiosk**

```
Open: http://localhost:3000/simulate.html
Click: "Register as kiosk"
See: "Registered as kiosk (Kiosk-Sim)"
```

**Step 2: Patient Takes Token**

```
Open: http://localhost:3000
Enter: Your name
Click: "Take Token"
See: Token number appears!
```

**Step 3: Watch Timer Count**

```
See: "Time waiting: 0s"
Wait: 5 seconds
See: "Time waiting: 5s" (counts up!)
```

**Step 4: Admin Marks Served**

```
Open: http://localhost:3000/admin.html
See: Your token in list
Click: "Serve"
See: Status changes to "Served"
```

**Done!** You've tested the complete flow! ✅
